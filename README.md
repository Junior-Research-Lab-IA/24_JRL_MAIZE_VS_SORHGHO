# 24_JRL_MAIZE_VS_SORGHUM
## *Maize or sorghum as non-irrigated crops ?*
  In the context of climate change exacerbating tensions on water usages, irrigated maize
raises legitimate concerns regarding its sustainability from water resource perspectives. In
contrast, sorghum has been gaining popularity as an effective alternative. Notably, sorghum
shares similar management practices and outlets with grain maize, requires fewer
agricultural inputs and would be more tolerant to heat and drought stress.
  However, this reputation is mostly based on trials at farm level with only very few direct
comparative studies. The very few available comparative trials are usually conducted on few
genotypes, ideally representing the “maize species” vs. the “sorghum species”. However,
there is a rich genetic diversity in each species and therefore potentially wide ranges of
"drought or temperature resistance". A consensus on the respective tolerance of sorghum and
maize could be the consequence of the narrow genetic variability that have been studied.
Indeed, current maize varieties have mostly been developed to maximize yields under optimal
condition. This is less true for sorghum, traditionally grown under rainfed conditions, and for
which selection has been less intensive.
  Today, it is clear that pursuing a model that prioritizes irrigated maize above all is no longer
acceptable, neither for the environment nor for society. But what model should be used for
summer crops? Should farmers, breeders, and supply chains turn to other more sustainable
crops like sorghum? Or does the genetic diversity of maize still hold interest for non-irrigated
environments subject to climate change?
